One thing that remains a mystery to me here is the difficulty I had using the `tmux source-file` command. What I wanted to be able to do was something more like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntmux new-session -d -s mutt; source-file path\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't get both commands to work in the same line. I'm confused about this because `hr mux` is able to do it so I guess I'm doing something wrong, but decided to move on before I could figure it out.\r\n\r\nCloses #31",

One thing that remains a mystery to me here is the difficulty I had using the `tmux source-file` command. What I wanted to be able to do was something more like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntmux new-session -d -s mutt; source-file path\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't get both commands to work in the same line. I'm confused about this because `hr mux` is able to do it so I guess I'm doing something wrong, but decided to move on before I could figure it out.\r\n\r\nCloses #31",

Once this is merged and deployed, we'd want to do a migration of those 2 over to this new `state_reason` value.",

Once this is merged and deployed, we'd want to do a migration of those 2 over to this new `state_reason` value."

Once this is merged and deployed, we'd want to do a migration of those 2 over to this new `state_reason` value.",
